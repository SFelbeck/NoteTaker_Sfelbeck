# NoteTaker_Sfelbeck

I struggled with this assignment quite a lot, the assignment was to add routing code for a notetaking app where you can add new notes with a button that appears in the upper right corner. However after a few hours of help from classmates I would up with code that was completely identical to the code of classmate that works and much of the functionality of the application still seemed not to start for me. If it somehow works for you mystery grader I would be very interested to know, but as things currently stand I'm out of time for extra troubleshooting so I'm submitting this and talking to a TA tomorrow.
