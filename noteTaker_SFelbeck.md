## Description: 
This application allows users to create a note title and text and then append them to a list. I was responsible for adding all routes and pathing for the assignment. This particular subject has proven to be rather difficult for me and I had to make heavy use of study groups. The biggest challenge in this project proved to be a stumpling block on the night of submission where I had an ongoing issue with the application not working in insomnia. With help from classmates who had completed the assignment; we debugged until we had virtually similar code and still the issues persisted until the next morning when run in the browser which was a very bitter pill.

## Usage:
Upon application load users will be directed to a page with a button to take them to the notes page, there they will find a title field and a text field. Input into either of those fields will cause a save button to appear which will append the note to a list on the left hand side.

## Installation: 
You will need to download express, fs, and uuidv4 

## Testing:
The user may attempt to create a note, success is when the save button shows up and appends the note.
